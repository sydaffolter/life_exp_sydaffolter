The following code is first loading the tidyverse package, then loading the gapminder 
dataframe with the line 'gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered'. 
Next, the code groups the life expectancy by year (using group_by()), and 
uses filter to find the country with the maximum life expectancy (using filter())
Using ungroup() and select(), the code separates and selects this information and 
saves it into a dataframe we have named sumdat by using arrange().

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered  |> 
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(year, country, lifeExp) |>
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat
```
